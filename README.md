# Healthcare Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of stroke using healthcare-related data.
It is an end-to-end machine learning project created for learning and internship preparation purposes.

The goal of this project is to understand and implement the complete machine learning workflow,
from data preprocessing to model evaluation and comparison.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains patient health and lifestyle information.
- Target variable: `stroke`

Features include:
- Age
- Gender
- Hypertension
- Heart disease
- BMI
- Smoking status
- Work type
- Residence type
- Other health indicators

---

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data quality checks (missing values, duplicates)
3. Missing value handling
4. Encoding categorical variables
5. Feature and target separation
6. Train–test split
7. Model training using multiple algorithms
8. Model evaluation
9. Model comparison and selection

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

---

## Model Comparison
Multiple models were trained and compared to understand their performance.
This approach helps in selecting the most suitable model for stroke prediction.

## Key Learnings
- Importance of proper data preprocessing in healthcare datasets
- Handling categorical and numerical features
- Comparing different machine learning algorithms
- Understanding evaluation metrics beyond accuracy
- Building an end-to-end ML pipeline
